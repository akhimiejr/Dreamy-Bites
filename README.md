# 1.1 Overview 
Dreamy Bites is a premium cookie brand offering a diverse range of gourmet products, including chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, and other specialty cookies. The brand has built a strong reputation for delivering high-quality products to both retailers and customers across global markets. As the business continues to expand, gaining deeper insight into sales trends, customer behaviour, and product performance has become essential to support strategic and data-driven decision-making.
However, Dreamy Bites currently faces challenges in consolidating its business data, which is dispersed across multiple sources. Product information and updated pricing are stored in a PDF document, customer details are maintained in a CSV file, and order transactions—including quantities and payment information—are recorded in a Google Sheet. This fragmented data structure limits efficient reporting, slows analysis, and makes it difficult to identify performance trends and growth opportunities
# 1.2 Aim of the Project
To integrate these diverse data sources into a
unified Power BI report, enabling Dreamy
Bites to:
• Analyze sales performance across products
and regions.
• Gain insights into customer demographics
and purchasing patterns.
• Track and manage order trends to optimize
inventory and delivery processes.
• Generate actionable reports to support
strategic planning and growth initiatives.
